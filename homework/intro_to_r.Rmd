##  Let's explore the dataset quakes looking at earthquakes off of Fiji.

1. Load quakes with `data(quakes)`. SHow what’s there  with str() and summary().

2. Show the entirity of the column `long`.

3. Hey, another useful function - unique()! Apply it to a vector, and you can see what are all of the unique values. It’s great for really digging into a problematic vector. 

What unique stations are there? Use `length()` with `unique()` to determine how many stations there are.

4. Using `range()`, what is the range of depths where quakes occur?

E.C. Where was the earthquake of largest magnitude found? You’ll need to use come comparisons and the `max()` function for this in your indices instead of a number!
