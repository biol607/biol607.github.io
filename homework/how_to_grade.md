1) For questions with code
	- 1 point for correct answer
	- 1 point for well documented code (either comments or description outside of code)
	- 1 point for breaking problem into logical steps, even if one of those goes awry somewhere
	
2) For questions without code
	- 1 point for thoughtful correct answer
	- 1 point for good writing
	- 1 point for concepts that demonstrate the student is on the right path, but cannot make the final connection to the answer


As for grading/comments - do so on the .Rmd files themselves.  For each comment from you, make it red as follows (this is outside of a code block - if they mess up code and you want to show them what’s the correct code, you can write your own code block as well, but, typically, I just write a short note explaining what went wrong)

Surround your text with the following

<font color=“red”>THIS IS THE TEXT YOU WRITE</font>

When you’re done, put a note like that at the top with their grade (X points out of Y) and re-knit the document.
