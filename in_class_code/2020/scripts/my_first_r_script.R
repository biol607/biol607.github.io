# Three mathematical things to show
# that R works as a calculator

1

1 + 2

1 * 2 + (3*4)


# next thing?

3/4
10 ^ 2
-1 + 1

# Arithmetic is cool - but what about complex functions?
sqrt(4)
log10(10)
log(5)

?log

log(x = 10, base = 10) #this is the most careful
log(10, base = 10) #this is more common usage
log(10, 10) #what does it mean?

??"logarithm"
