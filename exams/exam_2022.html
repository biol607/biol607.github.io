<p>Welcome to your mid-term! I hope you enjoy. Note, in all of the questions below, there are easy not so code intensive ways of doing it, and there are longer more involved, yet still workable ways to answer them. I would suggest that before you dive into analyses, you do the following.</p>
<p>First, breathe.</p>
<p>Second, think about the steps you need to execute to get answer the question. Write them down.</p>
<p>Third, for those parts of problems that require code, put those steps, in sequence, in comments in your script file. Use those as signposts to step-by-step walk through the things you need to do.</p>
<p>Fourth, go over these steps, and see if there are any that could be easily abstracted into functions, could be vectorized, or otherwise done so that you can expend the minimum amount of effort on the problem to get the correct answer.</p>
<p>The exam will be due on Nov 22nd, 5pm.</p>
<section id="sampling-your-system" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sampling-your-system">1. Sampling your system</h2>
<p>Each of you have a study system you work in and a question of interest. Give an example of one variable that you would sample in order to get a sense of its variation in nature. Describe, in detail, how you would sample for the population of that variable in order to understand its distribution. Questions to consider include, but are not limited to: Just what is your sample versus your population? What would your sampling design be? Why would you design it that particular way? What are potential confounding influences of both sampling technique and sample design that you need to be careful to avoid? What statistical distribution might the variable take, and why?</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="data-reshaping-and-visuzliation">2. Data Reshaping and Visuzliation</h2>
<p>Johns Hopkins has been maintaining one of the best Covid-19 timseries data sets out there. The data on the US can be found <a href="https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/blob/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_confirmed_US.csv">here</a> with information about what is in the data at https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data</p>
<section id="a.-access" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a.-access">2a. Access</h3>
<p>Download and read in the data. Can you do this without downloading, but read directly from the archive?</p>

<section id="b.-its-big-and-wide" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="b.-its-big-and-wide">2b. It’s big and wide!</h3>
<p>The data is, well, huge. It’s also wide, with dates as columns. Write a function that, given a state name as its input argument, will output a time series (long data where every row is a day) with columns for date, new daily cases and for cumulative cases in that state.</p>
<p>Note, let’s make the date column that emerges a true date object. Let’s say you’ve called it <code>date_col</code>. If you mutate it, <code>mutate(date_col = lubridate::mdy(date_col))</code>, it will be turned into a date object that will have a recognized order. {lubridate} is da bomb, and I’m hoping we have some time to cover it in the future.</p>
<p>Even better - impress yourself (if you want - not required!) and merge it with some other data source to also return cases per 100,000 people.</p>

<p>Great! Make a compelling plot of the timeseries for Massachusetts! Points for style, class, ease of understanding major trends, etc. Note, 10/10 for yourself only for the most killer figures. Don’t phone it in! Also, note <em>what</em> the data from JHU is. Do you want the cummulatives, or daily, or what? Want to highlight features? Events? Go wild!</p>

<p>Cool. Now, write a function that will take what you did above, and create a plot for any state - so, I enter Alaska and I get the plot for Alaska! If you really want to impress yourself (not required) highlight points of interest - but dynamically using the data.</p>

<section id="fit-and-evaluate-a-linear-model" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="fit-and-evaluate-a-linear-model">3. Fit and Evaluate a Linear model</h2>
<p>Let’s fit and evaluate a linear model! To motivate this, we’ll look at Burness et al.’s 2012 study “Post-hatch heat warms adult beaks: irreversible physiological plasticity in Japanese quail http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/280/1767/20131436.short the data for which they have made available at Data Dryad at http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.gs661. We’ll be doing a slightly modified version of their analysis.</p>
<section id="a.-what-should-i-do" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a.-what-should-i-do">3a. What should I do?</h3>
<p>Starting with loading this (new to you) data set for the very first time, what are the steps that you would take to analyze this data? Write them out! Maybe even in comments!</p>

</section>
<section id="b.-lets-get-started" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="b.-lets-get-started">3b. Let’s get started</h3>
<p>Load the data. Look at it. Anything interesting? Anything you’d want to watch out for? Or is it OK? Anything you’d change to make working with the data easier? Also, manipulate it a bit - for our analysis, we’re going to want Bird # and the Age of the birds to be categorical variables. Make sure we have variables that will work!</p>
</section>
<section id="c.-viz-before-fit" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="c.-viz-before-fit">3c. Viz before fit</h3>
<p>The model we will fit is one where we want to look at how temperature treatment affects the development of tarsus length over time (age). Visualize this. Make it look good! Is there anything here that would shape how you fit a model? Do you see why we are treating age as categorical?</p>

</div>
</section>
<section id="d.-fit-and-evaluate" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="d.-fit-and-evaluate">3d. Fit and evaluate</h3>
<p>Fit a model where tarsus length is predicted by age, treatment, their interaction, and a ‘block’ effect, as it were, of bird #. Evaluate the fit. Make any modifications as you see necessary due to your model checks. Note, it’s not going to be perfect (I checked the original - hey, you can too - and they’re on the edge) - but our models are robust, so we’re OK.</p>

<section id="e.-answer-the-question" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="e.-answer-the-question">3e. Answer the Question</h3>
<p>A central question of this paper is - does temperature affect the development of tarsus length. With your fit model in hand, answer the question, however you deem fit. Make sure that, alongside any numerical answers you produce, there is at least one stunning figure for a publishable paper!</p>

<p>Sometimes we bootstrap when things don’t <code>quite</code> meet parametric assumptions. In the above data, let’s look at a relationship and then bootstrap it’s coefficients.</p>
<section id="a.-the-relationship" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a.-the-relationship">4a. The relationship</h3>
<p>Look at the relationship between culmen and tarsus length using a linear model. What’s off here? Don’t worry about any other predictors for culmen length other than tarsus length.</p>

<section id="b.-a-function-a-function" class="level3">

<p>Write a function that, given a formula and a data set, will return the coefficients of a linear model fit to that data set as a tibble. Just the coefficients. Nothing else. Show that it works with the whole dataset to recover the coefficients from above.</p>

<section id="c.-sampling-your-data" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="c.-sampling-your-data">4c. Sampling your data</h3>
<p>Write a function that takes a dataset as input, then outputs a bootstrap sample of that data - it should have the same number of rows, and be sampled with replacement. Show that, if you make one bootstrapped replicate of your dataset and you fit a model using your function from above, your coefficients are a wee bit different. If you want to IMPRESS YOURSELF sample so that you get back the same number of rows of data by temperature and age (this is called stratified bootstrapping). Note - look at <code>sample()</code> or <code>dplyr::sample_frac()</code>.</p>

<section id="d.-boot-those-coefficients" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="d.-boot-those-coefficients">4d. Boot those coefficients</h3>

<section id="something-generalized" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="something-generalized">5. Something Generalized</h2>
<p>In their <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00442-011-1958-4">2011 paper</a>, Stanton-Geddes and Anderson assessed the role of a facultative mutualism between a legume and soil rhizobia in limiting the plant’s range. After publishing, they deposited their data at Dryad http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.8566. As part of their lab experiment, they looked at a variety of plant properties after growing plants with rhizobia from different regions. We want to look at what happened in that experiment during the March 12th sampling event.</p>
<section id="a.-fit-a-glm" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a.-fit-a-glm">5a. Fit a glm</h3>
<p>Load the data. Vizualize. Then, fit and evaluate a generalized linear model with your choice of error distribution looking at the effect of rhizobial region and plant height as measured on march 12 as predictors of # of leaves on march 12. Does your model meet assumptions? If not, refit with a different. Why did you chose this (or these) error distribution(s?</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="c.-prediction-intervals-from-a-distribution">5c. Prediction intervals from a distribution</h3>
<p>So, your distribution has quantiles (right? We see these in QQ plots). You can see what the value for those quantiles are from the <code>q*</code> function for a distribution. For example, the 95th percentile of a poisson with a <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> of 5 spans from 1 to 10. You can see this with <code>qpois(0.025, lambda = 5)</code> for the lower, and change it to 0.975 for the upper. Check this out. Plot the upper and lower bounds of the 95th percentile of a Poisson distribution over a range of lambdas from 1 to 30. Do the same for a negative binomial with means from 1 to 30. Note, to translate from a mean ( <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> ) with a size of 10 (you might have to look at the helpfile for qnbinom here).</p>

<section id="d.-prediction-intervals-from-your-model" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="d.-prediction-intervals-from-your-model">5d. Prediction intervals from your model</h3>
<p>All right! Armed with this knowledge, one of the frustrating things about <code>broom::augment()</code> for glm models is that it doesn’t have an <code>interval</code> argument. And has one trick. One - you need to see what scale your answer is returned on. We want to look at the response scale - the scale of the data. Second, while you can use <code>se_fit</code> to get standard errors, you don’t get a CI <em>per se</em> (although, hey, ~2*se = CI).</p>
<p>AND - we just looked at how when you have an estimated value, you can get the prediction CI yourself by hand in the previous part of the question. So, using your creativity, visualize the fit, 95% fit interval, and 95% prediction interval at the min, mean, and max of height for each treatment. Geoms can be anything you like! Have fun here!</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="e.-inmpress-yourself-prediction-intervals-from-your-model">5e. INMPRESS YOURSELF! Prediction intervals from your model</h3>
<p>Again, totally optional, but, check out the <a href="https://jebyrnes.github.io/sinterval/">sinterval package</a> which you’d have to install from github. It uses fit models and it’s two core functions <code>add_fitted_sims()</code> and <code>add_predicted_sims()</code> to get simulated values from fit models using one or the other interval. Do this, and visualize the same thing as above however you’d like (maybe look at <code>ggdist</code>?). Or try something new? Perhaps visualize across a range of heights, and not just three?</p>
