knitr::opts_chunk$set(eval = FALSE)
```

**1)** Complete problems 10 and 17-18 on pg. 109-111. Use R where possible. Data sets (so you don’t have to type things in) are available at http://www.zoology.ubc.ca/~whitlock/ABD/teaching/datasets.html.

**2)** A little while back, [Dave Curran](https://twitter.com/iamreddave) using some of the code from our lab made a wonderful animation of change in arctic sea ice.

He used data from   

ftp://sidads.colorado.edu/DATASETS/NOAA/G02135/north/daily/data/NH_seaice_extent_final_v2.csv
ftp://sidads.colorado.edu/DATASETS/NOAA/G02135/north/daily/data/NH_seaice_extent_nrt_v2.csv

I'm providing you with a cleaned form of his data (his code is [here](https://gist.github.com/cavedave/c5c2224c8c38661236c1c1ce894fd28f)) for you to work with in a few plots. The data file is called [NH_seaice_extent_monthly_1978_2016.csv](http://biol607.github.io/homework_2018/data/NH_seaice_extent_monthly_1978_2016.csv)

**2.1)** Load the data using `readr` and make the `Month_Names` column into a factor whose levels are in order of month using `forcats::fct_inorder`. Use `levels()` - a function that takes a factor vector and returns the unique levels - on the column. Are they in the right order?

```{r load}
#libraries
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
library(ggplot2)
library(forcats)

theme_set(theme_bw(base_size=12))

ice <- read_csv("./data/NH_seaice_extent_monthly_1978_2016.csv") %>%
  mutate(Month_Name = factor(Month_Name)) %>%
  mutate(Month_Name = fct_inorder(Month_Name))
```

**2.2)**  Try `fct_rev()` on `ice$Month_Name` (I called my data frame `ice` when I made this). What is the order of factor levels that results? Try out `fct_relevel()`, and last, `fct_recode()` as well. Look at the help files to learn more, and in particular try out the examples. Use these to guide how you try each functino out. After trying each of these, `mutate` month name to get the months in the right order, from January to December. Show that it worked with `levels()`  

Note, if you don't want a lot of output to be spit out, you can do something like `levels(fct_rev(ice$Month_Name))`.


```{r futz}
levels(fct_rev(ice$Month_Name))
levels(fct_relevel(ice$Month_Name, "Dec", "Jan"))
levels(fct_recode(ice$Month_Name, Month = "Jan"))

ice <- ice %>%
  mutate(Month_Name = fct_relevel(Month_Name, 
                                  "Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun",
                                  "Jul", "Aug", "Sep", "Oct", "Nov", "Dec"))

levels(ice$Month_Name)

```

**2.3)** Now, using what you have just learned about `forcats`, make a column called `Season` that is a copy of `Month_Name`. Use the function  `fct_recode` to turn it into a factor vector with the levels Winter, Spring, Summer, Fall in that order. Use `levels()` on `ice$Season` to show that it worked.

```{r}
ice <- ice %>%
  mutate(Season = fct_recode(Month_Name,
                             Winter = "Jan", Winter = "Feb", Spring = "Mar", Spring = "Apr", 
                             Spring = "May", Summer = "Jun",
                                 Summer = "Jul", Summer ="Aug", 
                             Fall = "Sep",Fall =  "Oct", Fall = "Nov", Winter = "Dec"))

levels(ice$Season)

```

**2.4)** Make a boxplot showing the variability in sea ice extent every month.

```{r boxplot}
ggplot(data = ice,
       mapping = aes(x = Month_Name, y = Extent)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

**2.4)** Use `dplyr` to get the annual minimum sea ice extent. Plot minimum ice by year, and add a trendline (either a smooth spline or a straight line).

```{r trend}
ice_summary <- ice %>%
  group_by(Year) %>%
  summarize(min_extent = min(Extent))

ggplot(ice_summary,
       aes(x = Year, y = min_extent)) +
  geom_point() +
  stat_smooth(method = "lm")
```


**2.5)** With the original data, plot sea ice by year, with different lines for different months. Then, use `facet_wrap` and `cut_interval(Month, n=4)` to split the plot into seasons.

```{r byyear}
year_plot <- ggplot(data = ice,
       mapping = aes(x = Year, y = Extent, group = Month)) +
  geom_line()

year_plot

year_plot + facet_wrap(~cut_interval(Month, n = 4))
```


**2.6)** Last, make a line plot of sea ice by month with different lines as different years. Gussy it up with colors by year, a different theme, and whatever other annotations, changes to axes, etc., you think best show the story of this data. For ideas, see the lab.

```{r fun}
library(viridis)

fancy <- ggplot(data = ice,
       mapping = aes(x = Month_Name, y = Extent, color = Year,
                     group = Year)) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_color_viridis(option = "A") +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 4, color = "darkgray", lty = 2) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 6, color = "darkgray", lty = 2) +
  scale_x_discrete(expand=c(0,0)) +
  annotate("text", x = 2, y = 6.5, label = "6º")+
  annotate("text", x = 2.5, y = 4.5, label = "4º")

fancy

```

**2.7 Extra Credit)** Make it animated with `gganimate`. Just like above. See the lab for more.  
  
```{r anim}
library(gganimate)

fancy +
  transition_time(Year)

fancy +
   transition_reveal(Year, along = Year) 
  
```

**2.8 Extra Credit)** Use the data and make something wholly new and awesome. Even extra extra credit for something amazing animated.
  
**3 Extra Credit)** Go to the internet, and find a package with some cool theme you want to use in ggplot2. Use it with one of the above plots. The cooler the theme, the more points we'll give!
Note - this guy - http://byrneslab.net/project/hensel/ - is in charge of deciding how cool it is.
