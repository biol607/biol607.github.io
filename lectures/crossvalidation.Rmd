# What is Out of Sample Prediction

1. We fit a model  

2. We have a new sample(s) with a full set of predictors

3. We apply the model to our new prediction

4. We see how badly we deviate from our fit model

# Common Out of Sample Metrics

$MSE = \frac{1}{n}\sum{(Y_i - \hat{Y})^2}$
     - In units of sums of squares

$RMSE = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n}\sum{(Y_i - \hat{Y})^2}}$
     - In units of response variable!
     - Estimate of SD of out of sample predictions
     
$Deviance = -2 \sum log(\space p(Y_i | \hat{Y}, \theta)\space)$
     - Probability-based
     - Encompasses a wide number of probability distributions
     - Just MSE for gaussian linear models!

# Evaluating Predictive Ability of Statistical Models: Cross-Validation

1. Fit a model on a **training** data set

2. Evaluate a Model on a **TEST** data set

3. Compare predictive ability of competing models with MSE, Deviance, etc.

---

# But.... what data do I use for training and testing?
## Random Cross-Validation

- Cross-validating on only one point could be biased by choice of poing

- So, choose a random subset of your data!

- Typically use a 60:40 split, or 70:30 for lower sample size

- Calculate fit metrics for alternate models

---
# A Random Cross-Validation Sample

```{r}
roach_rand <- initial_split(roaches, prop = 7/10)

labeled_roach <- bind_rows(
  tibble(training(roach_rand), type = "train"),
  tibble(testing(roach_rand), type = "test")
)

ggplot(labeled_roach,
       aes(x = temperature, y = rate,
           color = type)) +
  geom_point(size = 2)

```

             size = 2) +
  stat_smooth(method = "lm", fill = NA) +
  stat_smooth(method = "lm", fill = NA, color = "orange",
              formula = y ~ 1)

              formula = y ~ 1) +

# Results of Random CV

RMSE Temperature Model:

```

RMSE Intercept Only Model:
```{r}
lm(rate ~ 1, data = analysis(roach_rand)) %>%
  rmse(assessment(roach_rand))

This is the estimate of the SD of the training set - which is acceptable for your predictions?

# Problem: How Many Folds?

- What is a good number?
     - More folds = smaller test dataset
     - Bias-Variance tradeoff if also looking at coefficients

- 5 and 10 are fairly standard, depending on data set size

--


- More folds = closer to average out of sample error

- But, more folds can be computationally intensive

# How can we Use AIC Values?

$$\Delta AIC = AIC_{i} - min(AIC)$$


Rules of Thumb from Burnham and Anderson(2002):


--

- $\Delta$ AIC $<$ 2 implies that two models are similar in their fit to the data  

--

- $\Delta$ AIC between 3 and 7 indicate moderate, but less, support for retaining a model

--

- $\Delta$ AIC $>$ 10 indicates that the model is very unlikely 

---
# A Quantitative Measure of Relative Support

$$w_{i} = \frac{e^{-\Delta_{i}/2 }}{\displaystyle \sum^R_{r=1} e^{-\Delta_{i}/2 }}$$

Where $w_{i}$ is the *relative support* for model i
compared to other models in the set being considered.

Model weights summed together = 1

- **Model Comparison**: Comparison of alternate hypotheses
      - Deductive or Inductive
      - Either compare models to elminiate poor fits
      - Or... compare multiple models to determine how a system works
