# Inductive v. Deductive Reasoning

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
**Deductive Inference:** A larger theory is used to devise
many small tests.


**Inductive Inference:** Small pieces of evidence are used
to shape a larger theory and degree of belief.

# Applying Different Styles of Inference

- **Null Hypothesis Testing**: What's the probability that things are not influencing our data?
      - Deductive

- **Cross-Validation**: How good are you at predicting new data?
      - Deductive

- **Model Comparison**: Comparison of alternate hypotheses
      - Deductive or Inductive

- **Probabilistic Inference**: What's our degree of belief in a data?
      - Inductive

# The Core Philosophy of Frequentist Inference and Severe Statistical Testing

- We are estimating the probability of an outcome of an event over the long-term  

--

- Thus, we calculate a **test statistic** based on our **sample** assuming it is representative of a population  

--

- We compare that to the distribution of the test statistic from an assumed population  

--

- We ask, in the long-term, what's the probability of observing our test statistic of a more extreme statistic given our assumed population

# Applying Fisherian P-Values: Evaluation of a Test Statistic

We  use our data to calculate a **test statistic** that maps to a value

We can then calculate the probability of observing our data, or of observing data even more extreme, given that the null hypothesis is true.

# Neyman-Pearson Null Hypothesis Significance Testing

- For Industrial Quality Control, NHST was introduced to establish cutoffs of reasonable p, called an `\(\alpha\)`

- This corresponds to Confidence intervals: 1 - `\(\alpha\)` = CI of interest  

- Results with p `\(\le\)` `\(\alpha\)` are deemed **statistically significant**

---

# NHST in a nutshell

1. Establish a critical threshold below which one rejects a null hypothesis - `\(\alpha\)`\. *A priori* reasoning sets this threshold.

--

2. Neyman and Pearon state that if p `\(\le\)` `\(\alpha\)` then we reject the null. 
     - Think about this in a quality control setting - it's GREAT!  
--

3. Fisher suggested a typical `\(\alpha\)` of 0.05 as indicating **statistical significance**, although eschewed the idea of a decision procedure where a null is abandoned. 
    - Codified by the FDA for testing!  

--

4. This has become weaponized so that `\(\alpha = 0.05\)` has become a norm.... and often determines if something is worthy of being published?

# AND... Statistical Significance is NOT Biological Signficance.
]

---

# Why 0.05? Remember, 2SD = 95% CI

&gt; **It is convenient** to take this point as a limit in judging whether a deviation is to be considered significant or not. Deviations exceeding twice the standard deviation are thus formally regarded as significant

 Fisher, R.A. (1925) Statistical Methods for Research Workers, p. 47

---

# But Even Fisher Argued for Situational `\(\alpha\)`

&gt;If one in twenty does not seem high enough odds, we may, if we prefer it, draw the line at one in fifty (the 2 per cent point), or one in a hundred (the 1 per cent point). Personally, the writer prefers to set a low standard of significance at the 5 per cent point, and ignore entirely all results which fail to reach this level. A scientific fact should be regarded as experimentally established only if a properly designed experiment rarely fails to give this level of significance.

# And, Really, All of This is Just Fisher Dodging Royalty Payments

&gt; We were surprised to learn, in the course of writing this article, that the p&lt;0.05 cutoff was established as a competitive response to a disagreement over book royalties between two foundational statisticians. 

&gt; In the early 1920s, Kendall Pearson ... whose income depended on the sale of extensive statistical tables, was unwilling to allow Ronald A. Fisher to use them in his new book. To work around this barrier, Fisher created a method of inference based on only two values: p-values of 0.05 and 0.01.

from Brent Goldfarb and Andrew W. King. "Scientific Apophenia in Strategic Management Research: Significance &amp; Mistaken Inference." Strategic Management Journal, vol. 37, no. 1, Wiley, 2016, pp. 167–76.

---
# And really, what does p = 0.061 mean?

- There is a 6.1% chance of obtaining the observed data or more extreme data given that the null hypothesis is true.

- If you choose to reject the null, you have a ~ 1 in 16 chance of being wrong

- Are you comfortable with that? 

- OR - What other evidence would you need to make you more or less comfortable?


---
# How do you talk about results from a p-value?

- Based on your experimental design, what is a reasonable range of p-values to expect if the null is false

- Smaller p values indicate stronger support for rejection, larger ones weaker. Use that language! Not significance!

- Accumulate multiple lines of evidence so that the entire edifice of your research does not rest on a single p-value!!!!

---
# How I talk about p-values

- At different p-values, based on your study design, you will have different levels of confidence about rejecting your null. For example, based on the design of one study...

--

- A p value of less than 0.0001 means I have very high confidence in rejecting the null

--

- A p-value of 0.01 means I have high confidence in rejecting the null

--

- A p-value between 0.05 and 0.1 means I have some confidence in rejecting the null

--

- A p-value of &gt; 0.1 means I have low confidence in rejecting the null

- Does my model explain variability in the data?
     - **Null Hypothesis**: The ratio of variability from your predictors versus noise is 1

# Testing the Coefficients

- T-tests evaluate whether coefficients are different from 0

- Often, F and T agree - but not always
    - T can be more sensitive with multiple predictors
