# Inductive v. Deductive Reasoning

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
**Deductive Inference:** A larger theory is used to devise
many small tests.


**Inductive Inference:** Small pieces of evidence are used
to shape a larger theory and degree of belief.

# Applying Different Styles of Inference

- **Null Hypothesis Testing**: What's the probability that things are not influencing our data?
      - Deductive

- **Cross-Validation**: How good are you at predicting new data?
      - Deductive

- **Model Comparison**: Comparison of alternate hypotheses
      - Deductive or Inductive

- **Probabilistic Inference**: What's our degree of belief in a data?
      - Inductive

# Reifying Refutation - What is the probability something is false?

What if our hypothesis was that the resemblance-predator relationship was 2:1. We know our SE of our estimate is 0.57, so, we have a distribution of what we **could** observe.

# Applying Fisher: Evaluation of a Test Statistic

We  use our data to calculate a **test statistic** that maps to a value
of the null distribution. 

We can then calculate the probability of observing our data, or of observing data even more extreme, given that the null hypothesis is true.

# Neyman-Pearson Null Hypothesis Significance Testing

- For Industrial Quality Control, NHST was introduced to establish cutoffs of reasonable p, called an `\(\alpha\)`

- This corresponds to Confidence intervals - 1-$\alpha$ = CI of interest

- This has become weaponized so that `\(\alpha = 0.05\)` has become a norm.... and often determines if something is worthy of being published?
     - Chilling effect on science
     
---

# NHST in a nutshell

1. Establish a critical threshold below which one rejects a null hypothesis - `\(\alpha\)`\. *A priori* reasoning sets this threshold.

--

2. Neyman and Pearon state that if p `\(\le\)` `\(\alpha\)` then we reject the null. 
     - Think about this in a quality control setting - it's GREAT!
--

3. Fisher suggested a typical `\(\alpha\)` of 0.05 as indicating **statistical significance**, although eschewed the idea of a decision procedure where a null is abandoned. 
     - Codified by the FDA for testing!

# Types of Errors in a NHST framework


|                  |Ho is True   |Ho is False             |
|:-----------------|:------------|:-----------------------|
|Reject Ho         |Type I Error |Correct or Type S Error |
|Fail to Reject Ho |-            |Type II Error           |



- Possibility of Type I error regulated by choice of `\(\alpha\)`
  
- Probability of Type II error regulated by choice of `\(\beta\)`
  
- Probability of Type S error is called `\(\delta\)`

---
# Type I &amp; II Error

.center[
![](./images/nht/error_pregnant.jpg)
]
---
# Power of a Test

-   If `\(\beta\)` is the probability of committing a type II error,
1 - `\(\beta\)` is the power of a test.

-   The higher the power, the less of a chance of committing a type II
error.

-   We often want a power of 0.8 or higher. (20% chance of failing to reject a false null)

### `\(\alpha = 0.05\)` &amp; `\(\beta = 0.20\)`

5% Chance of Falsely Rejecting the Null, 20% Chance of Falsely Accepting the Null

--

Are you comfortable with this? Why or why not?

---

# What is Power, Anyway?

Given that we often begin by setting our acceptable `\(\alpha\)`, how do we
then determine `\(\beta\)` given our sample design?

-   Formula for a specific test, using sample size, effect size, etc.

-   Simulate many samples, and see how often we get the wrong answer
assuming a given `\(\alpha\)`!

---
# How do you talk about results from a p-value?

- Based on your experimental design, what is a reasonable range of p-values to expect if the null is false

- Smaller p values indicate stronger support for rejection, larger ones weaker. Use that language! Not significance!

- Accumulate multiple lines of evidence so that the entire edifice of your research does not rest on a single p-value!!!!

---
# For example, what does p = 0.061 mean?

- There is a 6.1% chance of obtaining the observed data or more extreme data given that the null hypothesis is true.

- If you choose to reject the null, you have a ~ 1 in 16 chance of being wrong

- Are you comfortable with that? 

- OR - What other evidence would you need to make you more or less comfortable?

---
# How I talk about p-values

- At different p-values, based on your study design, you will have different levels of confidence about rejecting your null. For example, based on the design of one study...

--

- A p value of less than 0.0001 means I have very high confidence in rejecting the null

--

- A p-value of 0.01 means I have high confidence in rejecting the null

--

- A p-value between 0.05 and 0.1 means I have some confidence in rejecting the null

--

- A p-value of &gt; 0.1 means I have low confidence in rejecting the null

---
# My Guiding Light
.center[
![](./images/15/ipcc_uncertainty_ar5.jpg)
]

---

# Why we need to be careful (because power!)

- In the search for the Higgs Boson, scientists studied billions of particles

- They used a "five-sigma" threshold (e.g., an observation beyond 5 SD)

- This corresponds to an `\(\alpha\)` of 0.0000003

## Take home: p-values are great for some kinds of inference. But, they only provide *one* answer at a time. Use carefully, and never depend on one p-value alone!

# Common Regression Test Statistics

- Does my model explain variability in the data?
     - **Null Hypothesis**: The ratio of variability from your predictors versus noise is 1
     - **Test Statistic**: F distribution (describes ratio of two variances)
     
- Are my coefficients not 0?
    - **Null Hypothesis**: Coefficients are 0  
    - **Test Statistic**: T distribution (normal distribution modified for low sample size)
    
---
# Does my model explain variability in the data?

Ho = The model predicts no variation in the data.  

Ha = The model predicts variation in the data.

--

To evaluate these hypotheses, we need to have a measure of variation explained by data versus error - the sums of squares!

--
`$$SS_{Total} = SS_{Regression} + SS_{Error}$$`

`\(SS_{E} = \sum(Y_{i} - \hat{Y}_{i})^2\)`, df=n-2


--
To compare them, we need to correct for different DF. This is the Mean
Square.

MS=SS/DF

e.g, `\(MS_{E} = \frac{SS_{E}}{n-2}\)`

`\(F = \frac{MS_{R}}{MS_{E}}\)` with DF=1,n-2

We  reject the null hypothesis that resemblance does not explain variability in predator approaches

---
# Testing the Coefficients

 -  F-Tests evaluate whether elements of the model contribute to variability in the data
      - Are modeled predictors just noise?
      - What's the difference between a model with only an intercept and an intercept and slope?

--

- T-tests evaluate whether coefficients are different from 0

--

- Often, F and T agree - but not always
    - T can be more sensitive with multiple predictors
