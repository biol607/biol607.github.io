# Properties of a good sample

1. Validity  
    - Yes, this is a measure of what I am interested in

2. Reliability  
      - If I sample again, I'll get something similar

3. Representative
      - Sample reflects the population
      - Unbiased


---

# Validity: Is it measuring what I think it's measuring?

.center[![:scale 75%](./images/03/23andme_health_ancestry_kit.jpg)]

---

# Reliability: Is my sample/measure repeatable?

.center[![](./images/03/painscale.jpg)]

---

# Bias from Unequal Representation
```{r colorSize,  echo=FALSE, fig.align='center',fig.width=6, fig.height=5}
```
If you only chose one color, you would only get one range of sizes.

---

# Unrepresentative Bias from Unequal Change of Sampling
```{r spatialBias,  echo=FALSE, fig.align='center',fig.width=6, fig.height=5}
```
--

Spatial gradient in size

---

# Unrepresentative bias from Unequal Choice of Sampling
```{r spatialSample,  echo=FALSE, fig.align='center',fig.width=6, fig.height=5}
```
Oh, I'll just grab those individuals closest to me...

---

# Solutions

1. Validity: Can you connect your measurement and question?

2. Reliability: Sample a standard or known population  

3. Representative: Sampling design!

---

# A more representative sample from Random Sampling
```{r spatialSample2,  echo=FALSE, fig.align='center',fig.width=6, fig.height=5}
```
--

Two sampling schemes

--

- Random - samples chosen using random numbers  

-- 

- Haphazard - samples chosen without any system (careful!)

---

# A more representative sample from **Stratified** Sampling
```{r stratified,  echo=FALSE, fig.align='center',fig.width=6, fig.height=5}
```
Sample over a known gradient, aka **cluster sampling**

Can incorporate multiple gradients

---

# Stratified or Random?

- How is your population defined?  


- What is the scale of your inference?  


- What might influence the inclusion of a replicate?  


- How important are external factors you know about?  


- How important are external factors you cannot assess?

  labs(y = "frequency")

sample_freq_plot

--
Frequency = % of Sample with that Value

---

# Visualizing Our Sample as Frequencies

Frequency = Probability Density, Sums to One.

# Ways to Describe Our Sample

- Describing it as a unique thing
     - What is the value smack in the middle?
     - What are large and small values like?
     - Is our sample clustered, or waaaay spread out?
     
- Describing it with reference to a population
      - If I were to draw from this sample, or it's like, what value would I most likely get?
      - If I assume a normal distribution, what's the range of 66% or 95% of the variability?
      - Is this sample peaked, flat, shifted one way or another?

# Sample Properties: **Variance**
How variable was that population?
$$\large s^2=  \frac{\displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^{n}{(X_i - \bar{X})^2}} {n-1}$$

* Sums of Squares over n-1  
* n-1 corrects for both sample size and sample bias  
* $\sigma^2$ if describing the population
* Units in square of measurement...

---
# Sample Properties: Standard Deviation
$$ \large s = \sqrt{s^2}$$  

* Units the same as the measurement
* If distribution is normal, 67% of data within 1 SD
* 95% within 2 SD
* $\sigma$ if describing the population
