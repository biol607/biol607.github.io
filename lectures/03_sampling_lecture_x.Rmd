# Properties of a good sample

1. Validity  
    - Yes, this is a measure of what I am interested in

2. Reliability  
      - If I sample again, I'll get something similar

3. Representative
      - Sample reflects the population
      - Unbiased

- **The mean**: If I were to draw from this sample, or it's like, what value would I most likely get?   

--
    
- **The standard deviation**: If I assume a normal distribution, what's the range of 66% or 95% of the variability?

# Sample Estimate of Population Properties: **Variance**
How variable was that population?
$$\large s^2=  \frac{\displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^{n}{(X_i - \bar{X})^2}} {n-1}$$

* Sums of Squares over n-1  
* n-1 corrects for biase from estimating from a sample.  
* $\sigma^2$ if describing the population
* Units in square of measurement...

---
# Sample Estimate of Population Properties: Standard Deviation
$$ \large s = \sqrt{s^2}$$  

* Units the same as the measurement
* If distribution is normal, 67% of data within 1 SD
* 95% within 2 SD
* $\sigma$ if describing the population

---
# Sample Estimate of Population Properties: **Skew**
How centrally distributed is your population?
$$\large s^2=  \frac{\displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^{n}{(X_i - \bar{X})^3}} {(n-1)s^3}$$

* Positive, peak is shifted right
* Negative, peak is shifted left
* Zero, it's nice and normal

---
# Sample Estimate of Population Properties: **Kurtosis**
How much of your population is close to the mode versus way out in the tails?
$$\large s^2=  \frac{\displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^{n}{(X_i - \bar{X})^4}} {(n-1)s^4}$$
* Larger than 3, sharply peaked distribution, narrow tails
     - leptokurtic
* Less than 3, flat distribution, wide tails  
     - platykurtic
* 3 - normal
