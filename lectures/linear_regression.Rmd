# The Steps of Statistical Modeling

1. What is your question?  
  
2. What model of the world matches your question?  
  
3. Is your model valid?  
  
4. Query your model to answer your question.

This is 90% of the modeling you will ever do because...

--

Everything is a linear model!

- multiple parameters (x1, x2, etc...)

- nonlinear transformations of y or x

- multiplicative terms (b * x1 * x2) are still additive

- generalized linear models with non-normal error

- and so much more....

# What are we doing with regression?

### Goals:  

--
1. Association

  - What is the strength of a relationship between two quantities
  - Not causal
  
--

2. Prediction
  - If we have two groups that differ in their X value by 1 unit, what is the average difference in their Y unit?
  - Not causal

--

3. Counterfactual
  - What would happen to an individual if their value of X increased by one unit?
  - Causal reasoning!

--
1. **Association:** A one unit increase in inbreeding coefficient is associated with ~11 fewer pups, on average.

2. **Prediction:** A new wolf with an inbreeding coefficient 1 unit greater than a second new wolf will have ~11 fewer pups, on average.

3. **Counterfactual:** If an individual wolf had had its inbreeding coefficient 1 unit higher, it would have ~11 fewer pups.

---
# Which of these is the correct thing to say? When?

1. **Association:** A one unit increase in inbreeding coefficient is associated with ~11 fewer pups, on average.

2. **Prediction:** A new wolf with an inbreeding coefficient 1 unit greater than a second new wolf will have ~11 fewer pups, on average.

3. **Counterfactual:** If an individual wolf had had its inbreeding coefficient 1 unit higher, it would have ~11 fewer pups.

# Two kinds of error

1. Fit error - error due to lack of precision in estimates  
      - Coefficient SE
      - Precision of estimates
  
2. Residual error - error due to variability not explained by X.
      - Residual SD (from $\epsilon_i$)

# Precision: coefficient SEs

- Sigma  is the SD of the residual 

$$\Large \epsilon_i \sim N(0,\sigma)$$

- How much does does # of pups vary beyond the relationship with inbreeding coefficient?

- For any number of pups estimated on average, ~68% of the # of pups observed will fall within ~1.5 of that number

  - Fraction of the variation in Y related to X.  
  
  - Here, 36.9% of the variation in pups is related to variation in Inbreeding Coefficient  
  
  - Relates to r, the Pearson correlation coefficient

# Modifying (transformating) Your Regression: Centering you X

- Centering X allows you to evaluate a meaningful intercept 
     - what is Y at the mean of X

# Modifying (transformating) Your Regression: Log Transform of Y

- Often, Y cannot be negative  
     
- And/or the process generating Y is *multiplicative*  
     
- Log(Y) can fix this and other sins. 
     
- **VERY** common, but, what do the coefficients mean? 
     - $exp(\beta_1) - 1 \approx$ percent change in Y for chance in 1 unit of X

---

# Other Ways of Looking at This Relationship: Log Transformation of Y

$$log(y_i) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + \epsilon_i$$
  - relationship is now curved
  - cannot have negative pups (yay!)

```{r logcoefs}

tidy(wolf_mod_log)[,1:3] %>%
  kable(digits = 3, "html") %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling("striped")
```

--
To understand the coefficient, remember
$$y_i = e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + \epsilon_i}$$

exp(-2.994)-1 = -0.95, so, a 1 unit increase in x causes y to lose 95% of its value, so...

--

**Association:** A one unit increase in inbreeding coefficient is associated with having 95% fewer pups, on average.
