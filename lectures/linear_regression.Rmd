This is 90% of the modeling you will ever do because...

Everything is a linear model!

- multiple parameters (x1, x2, etc...)

- nonlinear transformations of y or x

- multiplicative terms (b * x1 * x2) are still additive

- generalized linear models with non-normal error

- and so much more....

### Goals:  

--
1. Association

  - What is the strength of a relationship between two quantities
  - Not causal
  
--

2. Prediction
  - If we have two groups that differ in their X value by 1 unit, what is the average difference in their Y unit?
  - Not causal

--

3. Counterfactual
  - What would happen to an individual if their value of X increased by one unit?
  - Causal reasoning!

1. **Association:** A one unit increase in inbreeding coefficient is associated with ~11 fewer pups, on average.

2. **Prediction:** A new wolf with an inbreeding coefficient 1 unit greater than a second new wolf will have ~11 fewer pups, on average.

3. **Counterfactual:** If an individual wolf had had its inbreeding coefficient 1 unit higher, it would have ~11 fewer pups.

# Two Common Modifications (transformations) to Regression
1. Centering your X variable  

     - Many times X = 0 is silly
     
     - E.g., if you use year, are you going to regress back to 0?
     
     - Centering X allows you to evaluate a meaningful intercept 
           - what is Y at the mean of X  
            
--

2. Log Transforming Y

     - Often, Y cannot be negative  
     
     - And/or the process generating Y is *multiplicative*  
     
     - Log(Y) can fix this and other sins. 
     
     - **VERY** common, but, what do the coefficients mean? 
---

# Centering X to generate a meaningful intercept

$$x_{i  \space centered} = x_i - mean(x)$$

```{r coefs_cent}
wolves <- wolves %>%
  mutate(inbreeding.centered = inbreeding.coefficient -
           mean(inbreeding.coefficient))

cent_mod <- lm(pups ~inbreeding.centered, data = wolves )

tidy(cent_mod)[,1:3] %>%
  kable(digits = 3, "html") %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling("striped")
```

Intercept implies wolves with the average level of inbreeding in this study have ~4 pups. Wolves with higher inbreeding have fewer pups, wolves with lower inbreeding have more.

---

# Centering X to generate a meaningful intercept

```{r centplot}
ggplot(data=wolves, mapping=aes(x=inbreeding.centered, y=pups)) +

  theme_bw(base_size=24) +
  stat_smooth(method = "lm") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, color = "red", lty = 2)
```

---

# Other Ways of Looking at This Relationship: Log Transformation of Y

$$log(y_i) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + \epsilon_i$$
  - relationship is now curved
  - cannot have negative pups (yay!)

```{r logplot, fig.height=5, fig.width = 8}
wolfplot +
  stat_smooth(method = "glm", 
              method.args = list(family=gaussian(link = "log")))
```

---

# Model Coefficients: Log Slope

```{r logcoefs}
wolf_mod_log <- lm(log(pups) ~ inbreeding.coefficient,
               data = wolves)

tidy(wolf_mod_log)[,1:3] %>%
  kable(digits = 3, "html") %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling("striped")
```

--
To understand the coefficient, remember
$$y_i = e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + \epsilon_i}$$

exp(-2.994) = 0.05, so, a 1 unit increase in x causes y to change to 5% of its original value (a 95% loss) so...

--

**Association:** A one unit increase in inbreeding coefficient is associated with having 95% fewer pups, on average.
