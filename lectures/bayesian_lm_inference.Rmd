# Bayesian $R^2$

Classically, we use 

$$1 - \frac{\sigma^2}{s^2_{data}}$$

$$ = \frac{variance \, explained}{total \, variance}$$
But....

- $R^2$ under some draws can be negative 
     - Consider a draw where the slope is *VERY* steep relative to a flat relationship
     - Consider a very very strong prior
     
- $R^2$ depends on the data, and thus isn't a good absolute measure of model goodness of fit

---

# Bayesian $R^2$

$$\large R^2_{bayes} = \frac{variance \, explained}{variance \, explained + residual \, variance}$$

- Cannot be negative

- Based on model fit and draws from posterior relative to data

---

# Bayesian $R^2$ Visualized 

```{r r2}
knitr::kable(bayes_R2(puffer_brms, probs = c(0.1, 0.9)), "html")

# The Return of Cross-Validation!

- We can calculate MSE of refit models.... but we need something more general

--

- Enter the Pointwise Predictive Density (ELPD)

--

```{r}
puff_13 <- add_fitted_draws(puffer_brms, newdata = puffer[13,])
ggplot(puff_13,
       aes(x = .value,)) +
  stat_halfeye() +
  geom_vline(data = puff_13[1,], aes(xintercept = predators), color = "red", lty=2) +
  labs(subtitle = "Distribution of Posterior for Point 13\nObserved Value in Red")
```

---

# The Log Pointwise Predictive Density

$$\large lppd = \sum_i log \sum_s {p(y_i | \theta_s)}$$

- We take the log of the sum of the pointwise predictive density for all paramater values drawn from a chain

- We then sum this over *all* data points

- Kinda nice, no?

- It will have the same problem as MSE, etc., for overfitting
     - More parameters = better fit = higher lppd!
     
---

# Solutions to Overfitting

- An AIC-like score

- LOO Cross Validation

- K-fold Cross validation

---
# Penalty for Too Many Parameters

- As # of parameters goes up, lppd goes up

- BUT - as # of parameters goes up, variance in lppd for each point goes up
     - More parameters, higher SE per parameter, more variance in lppd

--

$$\large penalty = \sum_ivar(lppd_i)$$
--

- akin to # of parameters penalty

---
# The Widely Applicable Information Criterion

$$\LARGE WAIC = -2(lppd - penalty)$$

- Akin to AIC

- Can be calculated point by point

--

- But.... sensitive to extreme lppds

---
# WAIC from our Puffers

```{r waic, warning = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
waic(puffer_brms)
```

---
# WAIC Problems from our Puffers
```{r waicplot, warning = FALSE}
puffer_waic <- waic(puffer_brms, pointwise = TRUE)

ggplot(data.frame(puffer_waic$pointwise, r = 1:nrow(puffer_waic$pointwise)), 
       aes(x = r, y = elpd_waic)) + 
  geom_point()
```

---
# WAIC Problems from our Puffers
```{r waicplot_2, warning = FALSE}
puffer_waic <- waic(puffer_brms, pointwise = TRUE)

ggplot(data.frame(puffer_waic$pointwise, r = 1:nrow(puffer_waic$pointwise)), 
       aes(x = r, y = p_waic)) + 
  geom_point()
```

---

# LOO Cross-validation!

- OMG! We have to refit out model for every point? Didn't one take enough?

--

- Fear not, there is a solution!

--

- The posterior, p(H|D), is the *product* of the posterior for all data points

$$p(\theta|y) = \prod p(\theta|y_i)$$
--

- So, We can get our PPD for leaving out one data point by dividing the posterior by $p(\theta | y_i)$ - so deliciously simple!

--

- But, what if the importance of a given point is anomolusly large?

--

- Introducing, pareto smoothing

---

# The Pareto Distribution for Importance

- Vilfredo Pareto introduced the Pareto distribution to describe the distribution of wealth in a society
     - Leads to 80:20 rule, 80% of outcomes due to 20% of causes

- More commonly, a curve to describe relative importance

- We use it to smooth the relative importance values of each $lpd_i$


---

# The Pareto Distribution for Importance

```{r pareto}
dat <- tibble(
  x = seq(1,10,length.out=200),
  y = Pareto::dPareto(x, t = 0.1, alpha = 1.16)
)

ggplot(dat, aes(x = x, y = y)) + geom_line()
```

---

# LOO!

```{r loo, echo = TRUE}
loo(puffer_brms)
```

- k is an estimate of our shape parameter for the Pareto distribution

- if k > 0.5, we use K-Fold Cross validationt

---

# K-fold CV!

```{r kfold, echo = TRUE, cache = TRUE, message = FALSE}
kfold(puffer_brms, K = 5)
```

Expensive, though, as you actually have to refit for each fold

---

# Can then use LOO, WAIC, etc. to compare models

```{r puff_cubic, cache=TRUE, echo = FALSE, include = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message = FALSE}
puffer_cubic <- brm(predators ~ poly(resemblance, 3),
                     family = gaussian(link = "identity"),
                     data = puffer)
```

```{r puff_cubic, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
```

```{r puff_loo_cubic, warning = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
puffer_loo <- loo(puffer_brms)
puffer_cubic_loo <- loo(puffer_cubic)

loo_compare(puffer_loo, puffer_cubic_loo)
```
---

# Wrapping up...

- We can use many of the same inferential frameworks as before, but...

--

- The difference is that now we can begin to talk about our inferences in degree of certainty

--

- To adopt a Bayesian viewpoint on the world is to abandon the idea of a "True" parameter value

--

- We now see parameters as having a distribution

--

- The null is no longer of interest, but rather the probability of possibility is what drives us
