---
# The world isn't additive

-   Until now, we have assumed factors combine additively - the effect of one is not dependent on the effect of the other

--

-   BUT - what if the effect of one factor depends on another?

--

-   This is an **INTERACTION** and is quite common

--

- Biology: The science of "It depends..."  

--

-   This is challenging to think about and visualize, but if you can master it, you will go far!

# A Factorial Model

$$\large y_{ijk} = \beta_{0} + \sum \beta_{i}x_{i} + \sum \beta_{j}x_{j} + \sum \beta_{ij}x_{ij} + \epsilon_{ijk}$$  

$$\large \epsilon_{ijk} \sim N(0, \sigma^{2} )$$
$$\large x_{i} = 0,1, x_{j} = 0,1, x_{ij} = 0,1$$ 


- Note the new last term  

- Deviation due to treatment combination

This is still something that can be in the form

# Omnibus Tests for Interactions

- Can do an F-Test

$$SS_{Total} = SS_{A} + SS_{B} + SS_{AB} +SS_{Error}$$

$$SS_{AB} = n\sum_{i}\sum_{j}(\bar{Y_{ij}} - \bar{Y_{i}}- \bar{Y_{j}} - \bar{Y})^{2}$$
$$df=(i-1)(j-1)$$

--


- Can do an ANODEV
    - Compare A + B versus A + B + A:B

--

- Can do CV as we did before, only now one model has an interaction
     - Again, think about what models you are comparing
     
--

- Can look at finite population variance of interaction

# What do the  Coefficients Mean?

```{r graze_interaction_coefs}
tidy(graze_int_glm) %>%
  table_out
```

- Intercept chosen as basal condition (low, herbivores -)

--

- Changing height to high is associated with a loss of 10 units of algae relative to low/-

--


- Adding herbivores is associated with a loss of 22 units of algae relative to low/-

--

- BUT - if you add herbivores and mid, that's also associated with an increase of 25 units of algae relative to low/-

# Posthocs and Factorial Designs

-   Must look at simple effects first in the presence of an interaction  
     - The effects of individual treatment combinations
     - If you have an interaction, this is what you do!


--

-   Main effects describe effects of one variable in the complete absence of the other
    - Useful only if one treatment CAN be absent
    - Only have meaning if there is no interaction

---
# Posthoc Comparisons Averaging Over Blocks - Misleading!

  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, color = "red", lty = 2)

---
# Why think about interactions

- It Depends is a rule in biology

- Context dependent interactions everywhere

- Using categorical predictors in a factorial design is an elegant way to see interactions without worrying about shapes of relationships

- BUT - it all comes down to a general linear model! And the same inferential frameworks we have been dealing with since day 1

# What’s Going On: Type I, II, and III Sums of Squares

**Type I Sums of Squares:**  

--

&nbsp; &nbsp; SS for A calculated from a model with A + Intercept versus just Intercept

--

&nbsp; &nbsp; SS for B calculated from a model with A + B + Intercept versus A + Intercept

--

&nbsp; &nbsp; SS for A:B calculated from a model with A + B + A:B +Intercept versus A + B + Intercept

--

This is **fine** for a balanced design. Variation evenly partitioned.

# What’s Going On: Type I, II, and III Sums of Squares

**Type II Sums of Squares:**  

--

&nbsp; &nbsp; SS for A calculated from a model with A + B +  Intercept versus B + Intercept

--

&nbsp; &nbsp; SS for B calculated from a model with A + B + Intercept versus A + Intercept

--

&nbsp; &nbsp; SS for A:B calculated from a model with A + B + A:B +Intercept versus A + B + Intercept

Interaction not incorporated in assessing main effects

## What’s Going On: Type I, II, and III Sums of Squares


**Type III Sums of Squares:**  

--

&nbsp; &nbsp; SS for A calculated from a model with A + B + A:B + Intercept versus B + A:B + Intercept

--

&nbsp; &nbsp; SS for B calculated from a model with A + B + A:B + Intercept versus A + A:B + Intercept

--

&nbsp; &nbsp; SS for A:B calculated from a model with A + B + A:B +Intercept versus A + B + Intercept

Each SS is the unique contribution of a treatment

**very conservative**

# Which SS to Use?
-   Traditionally, urged to use Type III  

--

-   What do type III models mean?  
       -   A + B + A:B v. B + A:B  

--
-   Interactions the same for all, and if A:B is real, main effects not
    important  

--

-   Type III has lower power for main effects  

--

-   Type II produces more meaningful results if main effects are a concern - which they are!
