# Effects of Both Treatment and Block

```{r zooplankton_boxplot}
zoop <- read.csv("./data/21/18e2ZooplanktonDepredation.csv") %>%
  mutate(block = factor(block))
zoop_lm <- lm(zooplankton ~ treatment + block, data=zoop)


par(mfrow=c(1,2))
boxplot(zooplankton ~ treatment, data=zoop, xlab="Treatment", ylab = "Zooplankton Concentration", cex.lab=1.3)
boxplot(zooplankton ~ block, data=zoop, xlab="Block", cex.lab=1.3, ylab = "Zooplankton Concentration")
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
```

# Multiway ANOVA
- Many different treatment types  
     - 2-Way ANOVA is for Treatment and block
     - 3-Way for, e.g., Sticklebacks, Nutrients, and block
     - 4-way, etc., all possible  

--


- Assumes treatments are fully orthogonal  
    - Each type of treatment type A has all levels of treatment type B
    - E.g., Each stickleback treatment is present in each block

--

- Experiment is **balanced** for **simple effects**  
      - Simple effect is the unique combination of two or more treatments  
      - Balance implies the sample size for each treatment combination is the same  

--

- But, we can model even if unbalanced
     - Just need to adjust on how we evaluate the model

---
# Treatment Contrast Model for Multiway ANOVA/ANODEV/BANOVA

$$y_{ijk} = \beta_{0} + \sum \beta_{i}x_{i} + \sum \beta_{j}x_{j} + \epsilon_{ijk}$$  

$$\epsilon_{ijk} \sim N(0, \sigma^{2} )$$

$$\qquad x_{i} = 0,1$$
$$\qquad x_{j} = 0,1$$ 

i = treatment type 1, j = treatment type 2, k = replicate $\beta_0$ = reference treatment combination (i.e, control block 1) 




--



Or, with matrices, a general linear model...  

$$\boldsymbol{Y} = \boldsymbol{\beta X} + \boldsymbol{\epsilon}$$

# What does a Multiple Category Model Look like in Data?

Data
```{r}

# What does a Multiple Category Model Look like in Data?

Data Prepped for Model
```{r}

# Fits

**Least Squares**
```{r anova_lm, echo = TRUE}
zoop_lm <- lm(zooplankton ~ treatment + block, 
              data=zoop)
```

**Likelihood**
```{r anova_glm, echo = TRUE}
zoop_glm <- glm(zooplankton ~ treatment + block,
                data=zoop,
                family = gaussian(link = "identity"))

```

**Bayesian**
```{r anova_brm, cache = TRUE, echo = TRUE, results = "hide"}
zoop_brm <- brm(zooplankton ~ treatment + block,
                data=zoop,
                family = gaussian(link = "identity"),
                chains = 2)
```

# Assumptions of Multiway Anova
-   Independence of data points  
  
-   Normality within groups (of residuals)  
  
-   No relationship between fitted and residual values  
  
-   Homoscedasticity (homogeneity of variance) of groups  
  
-   .red[Additivity of Treatments]

---
# The Usual Suspects of Assumptions
```{r zoop_assumptions, fig.height=7}
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(zoop_lm, which=c(1,2,4), cex.lab=1.4)
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
```

---
# Group Residuals
```{r zoop_group_assumptions, fig.height=6}
residualPlots(zoop_lm, cex.lab=1.4, test=FALSE)
```

We now want to look at both sets of categories to evaluate HOV

---
# Group Residuals

Levene Test for Treatment
```{r levene}
leveneTest(zooplankton ~ treatment, 
                data=zoop) %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% table_out()
```

Levene Test for Block
```{r}
leveneTest(zooplankton ~ block,
                data=zoop)%>% 
   broom::tidy() %>% table_out()

```

# 
## Tukey's Test of Non-additivity:
- Our model is $y_{ij} = \mu + \alpha_i + \beta_j + \epsilon_{ij}$  

--

- But, if A and B are non-additive, results are incorrect.
    - Our model doesn't have an A*B term

--

- We don't have the DF with n=1 per treatment combination to calculate an interaction, so...  

--

- Assume a model of $y_{ij} = \mu + \alpha_i + \beta_j + \lambda\alpha_i\beta_j$  

--

- We can then test for $SS_{AB}$ using $\lambda\alpha_i\beta_j$

# What now?

- Which categories are associated with variability in our response?
     - ANOVA/ANODEV/BANOVA
     
- How much variability are we explaining?

- Do we want to compare to simpler models for predictive ability?

- Comparison of Means

---
# Hypotheses for Multiway ANOVA/ANODEV


TreatmentHo: $\mu_{i1} = \mu{i2} = \mu{i3} = ...$


Block Ho: $\mu_{j1} = \mu{j2} = \mu{j3} = ...$


i.e., The variane due to each treatment type is no different than noise

# We Decompose Sums of Squares for Multiway ANOVA

$SS_{Total} = SS_{Between A} + SS_{Between B} + SS_{Within}$

- Factors are Orthogonal and Balanced, so, Model SS can be split
     -   F-Test using Mean Squares as Before

- OR we compare y ~ a versus y ~ b to see if y ~ a + b has a higher likelihood
     - ANODEV LRT
     - Can also be done with F tests
     - Useful if data is unbalanced (called **type II comparison**)

---
# Put it to the Test

### F-Test
```{r zanova}
broom::tidy(anova(zoop_lm))%>%
    rename(F = statistic) %>%
  table_out
```

$R^2$ = `r round(summary(zoop_lm)$r.squared, 3)`

--
### ANODEV

```{r zanovadev}
broom::tidy(Anova(zoop_glm)) %>%
  rename(`LR Chisq` = statistic) %>%
  table_out
```

# AIC Analysis of Alternate Models - the models

```{r, echo = TRUE}
zoop_only_trt <- lm(zooplankton ~ treatment,
                     data = zoop)

zoop_only_block <- lm(zooplankton ~  block, 
                     data = zoop)

zoop_nuts_matter <- lm(zooplankton ~ 
                         I(treatment !="control")+ 
                         block, 
                     data = zoop)

zoop_null <- lm(zooplankton ~ 1, 
                     data = zoop)
```

---
# AIC Analysis of Alternate Models - Predictive Ability

```{r}
library(AICcmodavg)

mod_tab <- aictab(
  list(zoop_lm, zoop_only_trt, zoop_only_block,
       zoop_nuts_matter, zoop_null),
  c("All", "Only trt", "Only Block", "Nuts or Control", "Null")
)

as.data.frame(mod_tab)[,c(1:4,6)] %>% table_out

```

---
# How to evaluate effects of each treatment
1. Examine means estimates  



2. Evaluate treatment after parcelling out effect of other treatment  



3. Evaluate treatment at the median or mean level of other treatment


---
# Evaluating Means

```{r coefTab}
knitr::kable(tidy(update(zoop_lm, .~.- 1))) %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling()
```

---
# Parcelling Out Second Treatment
```{r visualize_treatments}
crPlots(zoop_lm)
```

Component-Residual Plots take examine unique effect of one treatment after removing influence of the other.

---
# Median Value of Second Treatment
```{r visreg}
library(patchwork)
visreg(zoop_lm, "treatment", gg=TRUE) + visreg::visreg(zoop_lm, "block", gg=TRUE)
```

---
# Comparison of Differences at Average of Other Treatment
```{r lsmeans}
contrast( emmeans(zoop_brm, "treatment"), "tukey", adjust="tukey") %>%
  table_out

```

Can use whatever contrast style you'd like, and can do this for any set of categories
