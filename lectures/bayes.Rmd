### You start with a Prior

```{r bayesplot_1}
bdat_unstd <- tibble(
  x = seq(-20,30, length.out = 200),
  prior = dnorm(x, -2, 5),
  likelihood = dnorm(x, 10, 3),
  posterior = prior * likelihood/sum(prior*likelihood)
) %>%
  gather(type, value, -x) %>%
  group_by(type) 

bdat <- bdat_unstd %>%
  mutate(value = value/max(value))

bplot <- ggplot(bdat,
       aes(x = x, y = value, color = type)) +
  geom_line(alpha = 0) +
  geom_line(data= bdat %>% filter(type == "prior"),
            size = 1.4) +

# What is a posterior distribution?

post
```

---
# What is a posterior distribution?
```{r post_2}
post +
  geom_vline(xintercept=13, color="red", lty=2)
```

The probability that the parameter is 13 is 0.4

---
# What is a posterior distribution?
```{r post_3}
post +
  geom_vline(xintercept=13, color="red", lty=2)+
  geom_vline(xintercept=10, color="blue", lty=2)
```

The probability that the parameter is 13 is 0.4  
The probability that the parameter is 10 is 0.044

---
# What is a posterior distribution?
```{r post2}
x2 <- seq(12,13, by=0.01)
y2 <- dnorm(x2, 13)

post +
  geom_area(mapping=aes(x=x2, y=y2), fill="red")

```

Probability that parameter is between 12 and 13 = `r sum(y2)*0.01`

---
# Bayesian Credible Interval
```{r post3}
x3 <- seq(11,15, by=0.01)
y3 <- dnorm(x3, 13)

post +
  geom_area(mapping=aes(x=x3, y=y3), fill="red")

```

Area that contains 95% of the probability mass of the posterior distribution

# Evaluation of a Posterior: Bayesian Credible Intervals

In Bayesian analyses, the **95% Credible Interval** is the region in which we find 95% of the possible parameter values. The observed parameter is drawn from this distribution. For normally distributed parameters:  

$$\hat{\beta} - 2*\hat{SD} \le \hat{\beta} \le \hat{\beta} +2*\hat{SD}$$ 

where $\hat{SD}$ is the SD of the posterior distribution of the parameter $\beta$. Note, for non-normal posteriors, the distribution may be different.
---

# Evaluation of a Posterior: Frequentist Confidence Intervals

In Frequentist analyses, the **95% Confidence Interval** of a parameter is the region in which, were we to repeat the experiment an infinite number of times, the *true value* would occur 95% of the time.
For normal distributions of parameters: 



$$\hat{\beta} - t(\alpha, df)SE_{\beta} \le \beta \le \hat{\beta} +t(\alpha, df)SE_{\beta}$$

---

# Credible Intervals versus Confidence Intervals

- Frequentist Confidence Intervals tell you the region you have confidence a **true value** of a parameter may occur 

--

- If you have an estimate of 5 with a Frequentist CI of 2, you cannot say how likely it is that the parameter is 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7  

--

- Bayesian Credible Intervals tell you the region that you have some probability of a parameter value 

--

- With an estimate of 5 and a CI of 2, you can make statements about degree of belief in whether a parmeter is 3, 4,5, 6 or 7 - or even the probability that it falls outside of those bounds

---
# Degree of beliefe in a result

```{r p}
xp <- seq(-2,5, by = 0.001)
yp <- dnorm(xp, 2)

xp1 <- seq(-2,0, by = 0.001)
yp1 <- dnorm(xp1, 2)

 qplot(xp,yp,geom="line") +
  theme_bw(base_size=17) +
  xlab("Parameter") +
  ylab("Probability") +
  geom_area(mapping=aes(x=xp1, y=yp1), fill="red")
```

You can discuss the probability that your parameter is opposite in sign to its posterior modal estimate. This yields a degree of belief that you at least have the sign correct (i.e., belief in observing a non-zero value)

# How Do We Choose a Prior?

[The Prior Choice Wiki!](https://github.com/stan-dev/stan/wiki/Prior-Choice-Recommendations)

[Lemoine 2019 Oikos](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/oik.05985)


--

1. Determine if there are limits to what is possible for a parameter. Use them!

2. Do you have real prior information? Use it! But perhaps increase uncertainty to be conservative.

3. Do you have no information? Center around 0, but choose how much of a **regularization penalty** you want to impose.

4. Scaling your inputs (z-transform, etc) can often help, as you can then use a normal distribution to set priors.

5. Certain parameter types have favored prior distributions - we'll discuss!

---
# Types of Priors

- Flat prior (not usually recommended);

- Super-vague but proper prior: normal(0, 1e6) (not usually recommended)

- Weakly informative prior, very weak: normal(0, 10)

- Generic weakly informative prior: normal(0, 1);

- Specific informative prior: normal(0.4, 0.2) or whatever matches previous literature or what you know of the natural history of the system

# How Will We Use Bayesian Inference for Linear Regression?

$$\Large p(\theta | D) = \frac{p(D | \theta)P(\theta)}{\int p(D | \theta)p(\theta)d\theta}$$

Remember, $P(D|\theta)$ is just a likelihood - we've done this before for linear models! We can even grid sample this!
