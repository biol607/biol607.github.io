# Representativeness: Does Your Data Represent the Population?

- Always question if you did a good job sampling

- Use natural history and the literature to get the bounds of values

- If experimenting, make sure your treatment levels are representative

- Are all replicates TRULY independent

- Did they come from the same space, time, etc.

# Equal Variance of Errors: Problems and Solutions

- Shapes (cones, footballs, etc.) with no bias in fitted v. residual relationship

- A linear relationship indicates an additivity problem

- Can solve with a better model (more predictors)

- Can solve with weighting by X values, if source of heteroskedasticity known
     - This actually means we model the variance as a function of X
     - `\(\epsilon_i \sim(N, f(x_i))\)`
 
- Minor problem for coefficient estimates

- Major problem for doing inference and prediction as it changes error

---
# Normality of errors: Did we fit the error generating process that we observed?

- We assumed `\(\epsilon_i \sim N(0,\sigma)\)` - but is that right?

- Can assess with a QQ-plot
     - Do quantiles of the residuals match quantiles of a normal distribution?
     
- Again, minor problem for coefficient estimates

# Method of Model Fitting

1. Least Squares
  - Conceptually Simple
  - Minimizes distance between fit and residuals
  - Approximations of quantities based on frequentist logic
  
2. Likelihood
  - Flexible to many error distributions and other problems
  - Produces likelihood surface of different parameter values
  - Equivalent to least square for Gaussian likelihood
  - Approximations of quantities based on frequentist logic

3. Bayesian
  - Incorporates prior knowledge
  - Probability for any parameter is likelihood * prior
  - Superior for quantifying uncertainty
  - With "flat" priors, equivalent to least squares/likelihood
  - Analytic or simulated calculation of quantities

# Inductive v. Deductive Reasoning

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
**Deductive Inference:** A larger theory is used to devise
many small tests.


**Inductive Inference:** Small pieces of evidence are used
to shape a larger theory and degree of belief.
---

# Applying Different Styles of Inference

- **Null Hypothesis Testing**: What's the probability that things are not influencing our data?
      - Deductive

- **Cross-Validation**: How good are you at predicting new data?
      - Deductive

- **Model Comparison**: Comparison of alternate hypotheses
      - Deductive or Inductive

- **Probabilistic Inference**: What's our degree of belief in a data?
      - Inductive

# Reifying Refutation - What is the probability something is false?

# To falsify the 2:1 hypothesis, we need to know the probability of observing 3, or something GREATER than 3.

# Applying Fisher: Evaluation of a Test Statistic

We  use our data to calculate a **test statistic** that maps to a value
of the null distribution. 

We can then calculate the probability of observing our data, or of observing data even more extreme, given that the null hypothesis is true.


`$$\large P(X \leq Data | H_{0})$$`

# Problems with P

- Most people don't understand it.
     - See American Statistical Society' recent statements
     
--
- Like SE, it gets smaller with sample size!
--
- Neyman-Pearson Null Hypothesis Significance Testing
     - For Industrial Quality Control, NHST was introduced to establish cutoffs of reasonable p, called an `\(\alpha\)`
     - This corresponds to Confidence intervals - 1-$\alpha$ = CI of interest
     - This has become weaponized so that `\(\alpha = 0.05\)` has become a norm.... and often determines if something is worthy of being published?
     - Chilling effect on science
     
--
- We don't know how to talk about it

---
# How do you talk about results from a p-value?

- Based on your experimental design, what is a reasonable range of p-values to expect if the null is false

- Smaller p values indicate stronger support for rejection, larger ones weaker. Use that language.

- Accumulate multiple lines of evidence so that the entire edifice of your research does not rest on a single p-value!!!!

---
# For example, what does p = 0.061 mean?

- There is a 6.1% chance of obtaining the observed data or more extreme data given that the null hypothesis is true.

- If you choose to reject the null, you have a ~ 1 in 16 chance of being wrong

- Are you comfortable with that? 

- OR - What other evidence would you need to make you more or less comfortable?

---

# Common Regression Test Statistics

- Does my model explain variability in the data?
     - **Null Hypothesis**: The ratio of variability from your predictors versus noise is 1
     - **Test Statistic**: F distribution (describes ratio of two variances)
     
- Are my coefficients not 0?
    - **Null Hypothesis**: Coefficients are 0  
    - **Test Statistic**: T distribution (normal distribution modified for low sample size)
    
---
# Does my model explain variability in the data?

Ho = The model predicts no variation in the data.  

Ha = The model predicts variation in the data.

--

To evaluate these hypotheses, we need to have a measure of variation explained by data versus error - the sums of squares!

--
`$$SS_{Total} = SS_{Regression} + SS_{Error}$$`

`\(SS_{E} = \sum(Y_{i} - \hat{Y}_{i})^2\)`, df=n-2


--
To compare them, we need to correct for different DF. This is the Mean
Square.

MS=SS/DF

e.g, `\(MS_{E} = \frac{SS_{E}}{n-2}\)`

# The F Distribution and Ratios of Variances

`\(F = \frac{MS_{R}}{MS_{E}}\)` with DF=1,n-2

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
--
We  reject the null hypothesis that resemblance does not explain variability in predator approaches

---
# Testing the Coefficients

 -  F-Tests evaluate whether elements of the model contribute to variability in the data
      - Are modeled predictors just noise?
      - What's the difference between a model with only an intercept and an intercept and slope?

--

- T-tests evaluate whether coefficients are different from 0

--

- Often, F and T agree - but not always
    - T can be more sensitive with multiple predictors
