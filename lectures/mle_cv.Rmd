class: middle

# Likelihood: how well data support a given hypothesis.

--


### Note: Each and every parameter choice IS a hypothesis

---

# Likelihood Defined
<br><br>
$$\Large L(H | D) = p(D | H)$$



Where the D is the data and H is the hypothesis (model) including a both a data generating process with some choice of parameters (often called $\theta$). The error generating process is inherent in the choice of probability distribution used for calculation.

---
# Thinking in Terms of Models and Likelihood

- First we have a **Data Generating Process**

     - This is our hypothesis about how the world works
     
     - $\hat{y}_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i$ 
     
--

- Then we have a likelihood of the data given this hypothesis
     - This allows us to calculate the likelihood of observing our data given the hypothesis
     
     - Called the **Likelihood Function**
     
     - $y_{i} = N(\hat{y}_i, \sigma)$

---
# All Kinds of Likelihood functions
- Probability density functions are the most common  

--

- But, hey, $\sum(y_{i} - \hat{y}_i)^2$ is one as well

--

- Extremely flexible

--

- The key is a function that can find a minimum or maximum value, depending on your parameters

# Likelihood of a Single Value
What is the likelihood of a value of 1.5 given a hypothesized Normal distribution where the mean is 0 and the SD is 1?

```{r norm_lik}
x <- seq(-3,3, length.out=200)
y <- dnorm(x)
normplot <- qplot(x,y, geom="line") + theme_bw(base_size=17) +
  ylab("Density") + xlab("X")

normplot
```

---
# Likelihood of a Single Value
What is the likelihood of a value of 1.5 given a hypothesized Normal distribution where the mean is 0 and the SD is 1. 

```{r norm_lik_2} 
normline <- normplot + 
  geom_segment(mapping=aes(x=1.5, xend=1.5, y = 0, yend = dnorm(1.5)), size=1.3, color="red")

normline
```

--

$$\mathcal{L}(\mu = 0, \sigma = 1 | Data = 1.5) = dnorm(1.5,  \mu = 0, \sigma = 1)$$

## The Maximum Likelihood Estimate is the value at which $p(D | \theta)$ - our likelihood function -  is highest.

--

#### To find it, we search across various values of $\theta$

# MLE for Multiple Data Points

Let's say this is our data:
```{r}
set.seed(2020)
dat <- rnorm(20, 3, 1)
dat
```

--

We know that the data comes from a normal population with a $\sigma$ of 1.... but we want to get the MLE of the mean.

--

$p(D|\theta) = \prod p(D_i|\theta)$

&nbsp; &nbsp;     = $\prod dnorm(D_i, \mu, \sigma = 1)$

# The Likelihood Surface

# The Log-Likelihood Surface

We use Log-Likelihood as it is not subject to rounding error, and approximately $\chi^2$ distributed.

```{r loglik_surf}

ml_search_ll <- tibble(mu = seq(2.1,3.7,length.out = 500)) %>%
  rowwise(mu) %>%
  summarise(lik = sum(dnorm(dat, mu, 1, log = TRUE))) %>%

ggplot(ml_search_ll,
       aes(x = mu, y = lik)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  labs(y = "Log-Likelihood")
```
---

# The $\chi^2$ Distribution

- Distribution of sums of squares of k data points drawn from N(0,1)

- k = Degrees of Freedom

- Measures goodness of fit

- A large probability density indicates a match between the squared difference of an observation and expectation

---

# The $\chi^2$ Distribution, Visually
```{r chisq_dist}
cdat <- crossing(k = seq(1,9,2),
                 x = seq(0.25,8, length.out = 200)) %>%
  mutate(density = dchisq(x, k))

               lty = 2, color = "red", size = 2)

se_plot
```

---

# Hey, Look, it's the 95% CI!

The 95% CI of  a $\chi^2$ distribution is 1.92, so....

```{r ll_ci}
se_plot +  
  geom_point(data = ci_ci, color = "purple", size = 4) +
  geom_segment(data = ci_ci, aes(x = mu, xend = mu,

# The Deviance: -2 * Log-Likelihood

- Measure of fit. Smaller deviance = closer to perfect fit  
- We are minimizing now, just like minimizing sums of squares 
- Point deviance residuals have meaning  
- Point deviance of linear regression = mean square error!

```{r show_dev, fig.height = 5}

ml_search_ll <- ml_search_ll %>%

# Well Behaved Likelihood Profiles

- To get a profile for a single paramter, we calculate the MLE of all other parameters at different estimates of our parameter of interest

- This *should* produce a nice quadratic curve, as we saw before

- This is how we get our CI and SE (although we usually assume a quadratic distribution for speed)

- BUT - with more complex models, we can get weird valleys, multiple optima, etc.

- Common sign of a poorly fitting model - other diagnostics likely to fail as well

# But - What do the Likelihood Profiles Look Like?

## Likelihood Ratios
<br>
$$\LARGE G = \frac{L(H_1 | D)}{L(H_2 | D)}$$

- G is the ratio of *Maximum Likelihoods* from each model  
--

- Used to compare goodness of fit of different models/hypotheses  
--

- Most often, $\theta$ = MLE versus $\theta$ = 0  

--

- $-2 log(G)$ is $\chi^2$ distributed  

---
# Likelihood Ratio Test

- A new test statistic: $D = -2 log(G)$  

--

- $= 2 [Log(L(H_2 | D)) - Log(L(H_1 | D))]$  

--

- It's $\chi^2$ distributed!   
     - DF = Difference in # of Parameters  

--

- If $H_1$ is the Null Model, we have support for our alternate model

---
# Likelihood Ratio Test for Regression

- We compare our slope + intercept to a model fit with only an intercept!

- Note, models must have the SAME response variable

```{r intmod, echo = TRUE}
int_only <- glm(predators ~ 1, data = puffer)
```

--

- We then use *Analysis of Deviance* (ANODEV)

---
# Our First ANODEV

```{r}
anova(int_only, puffer_glm, test = "LRT")
```

---
# When to Use Likelihood?


.pull-left[
- Great for **complex models** (beyond lm)

- Great for anything with an **objective function** you can minimize

- AND, even lm has a likelihood!
