# Generalized Linear Models: Distributions


1.  The error distribution is from the **exponential family**
  - e.g., Normal, Poisson, Binomial, and more.  

--

2.  For these distributions, the variance is a funciton of the fitted
    value on the curve: $var(Y_i) = \theta V(\hat{Y_i})$
  - For a normal distribution, $var(Y_i) = \theta*1$ as
        $V(\hat{Y_i})=1$   

  - For a poisson distribution, $var(Y_i) = 1*\mu_i$ as
  $V(\hat{Y_i})=\hat{Y_i}$  

--

3. They have *canonical links* which are link functions that fall out from the shape of the distribution and map on to the domain of possible values  

  - e.g., the identity for the Gaussian  
     
  - We can also use non-canonical links  
        
---
# Distributions, Canonical Links, and Dispersion

|Distribution | Canonical Link | Variance Function|
|-------------|-------------|-------------|
|Normal | identity | $\theta$|
|Poisson | log | $\hat{Y_i}$|
|Binomial | logit | $\hat{Y_i}(1-\hat{Y_i})$|
|Negative Binomial | log | $\hat{Y_i} + \theta\hat{Y_i}^2$|
|Gamma | inverse | $\hat{Y_i}^2$|
| Beta | logit | $\hat{Y_i}(1 - \hat{Y_i})/(\theta + 1)$|

The key is to think about your residual variance and what is appropriate

### The Odds


## The Odds

$$Odds  = \frac{p}{1-p}$$
(e.g., 50:50 is an odds ratio of 1, 2:1 odds are pretty good! 1:100 odds is not!)

--

Logit coefficients are in:

$$Log-Odds = Log\frac{p}{1-p} = logit(p)$$

(log of 1 is 0, log of .69, log of .01 is -4.60517)

# Coefficients and Interpretation

```{r}
tidy(crypto_glm) |>
  dplyr::select(1:3) |>
  knitr::kable(digits = 3) |>
  kableExtra::kable_styling()
```

--

- Woof. Logit coefficients are tricky (go visualization!)  

--

- In essence, an increase in 1 unit of dose = an exp( 0.0135) increase in the ODDS of infection  
      - 1.014 increase (remember, 1 is a 50:50 chance!)

--

- You *can* use this to estimate change in %, but it requires knowing where you start from on the curve (this is a nonlinear curve after all)

---

# Final Note on Logistic Regression

- Ideal for yes/no classification  
     - e.g. if your response variable is purely binary

- Has an extension to *multinomial logistic regression*
      - Many categories, often used for classification

- Only use if you can represent data as indepenent *trials*  
      - Internally, breaks responses into yes/no

# Ruh Roh! What happened? Overdispersion of Data!
- When the variance increases faster than the mean, our data is overdispersed  

--

- This can be solved with different distributions whose variance have different properties  
--

 - OR, we can fit a model, then scale it’s variance posthoc with a coefficient  

--

-  The likelihood of these latter models is called a Quasi-likelihood, as it does not reflect the true spread of the data  
      - Good to avoid, as it causes inferential difficulties down the line
      
---
# For Count Data, Two Common Solutions

1. Negative Binomial
  - Variance = $\hat{Y_i}^2 + \theta\hat{Y_i}^2$|$
  - Increases with the square, not linearly
  - Although some forms also do linear...
  - Common for **clumped data**  
  
--

2. Quasi-Poisson  
  - Basically, Variance = $\theta\hat{Y}$  
  - Posthoc estimation of $\theta$
  - (Also a similar quasibinomial)  

--

3. Others where you model dispersion explicitly
  - You are in deeper waters here
