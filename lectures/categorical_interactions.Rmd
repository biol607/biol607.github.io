# The world isn't additive

-   Until now, we have assumed predictors combine additively  
     - the effect of one is not dependent on the effect of the other

--

-   BUT - what if the effect of one variable depends on the level of another?

--

-   This is an **INTERACTION** and is quite common  
     - Heck, a squared term is the interaction of a variable with itself!

--

- Biology: The science of "It depends..."  

--

-   This is challenging to think about and visualize, but if you can master it, you will go far!

- Intercept chosen as basal condition (low, herbivores -)  

--

- Changing height to high is associated with a loss of 10 units of algae relative to low/-

--


- Adding herbivores is associated with a loss of 22 units of algae relative to low/-

--

- BUT - if you add herbivores and mid, that's also associated with an additional increase of 25 units of algae relative to mid and + alone  
      - 25.5 - 22.5 - 10.4 = only a loss of 7.4 relative to low/-

# Posthoc Estimated Means and Interactions with Categorical Variables

-   Must look at **simple effects** first in the presence of an interaction  
     - The effects of individual treatment combinations
     - If you have an interaction, this is what you do!

# Why think about interactions

- It Depends is a rule in biology

- Context dependent interactions everywhere

- Using categorical predictors in a factorial design is an elegant way to see interactions without worrying about shapes of relationships

- BUT - it all comes down to a general linear model! And the same inferential frameworks we have been dealing with since linear regression!

# Final Thought - You can have 2, 3, and more-way interactions!
