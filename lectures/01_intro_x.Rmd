# Some zoom ettiquite

- If you *can*, keep your cameras on. I rely on your facial feedback!  
      - But if you don't want to, are eating, are being bodyslammed by toddlers, are at another job, just got out of the shower, etc. *THAT IS FINE*  
      
- As I'm usually full screen, so, to ask questions, chat - it flashes in my screen!  
  
- You can also PM Michael at any time.  
  
- Extra credit for fluffs  

- We will also use Etherpad for communication (next slide!)  
  
- I will record all classes and labs if you cannot make it

# Course Goals

1. Learn how to think about your research in a systematic way to design efficient observational & experimental studies.  <br><br> 

--

2. Understand how to get the most bang for your buck from your data.  <br><br> 

--

3. Make you effective collaborators with statisticians.  <br><br> 

--

4. Make you comfortable enough to learn and grow beyond this class.  

---

# What are we doing here?
## Course divided into blocks

--

1. Introduction to computation and reproducibility

--

2. Regression and Inference

--

3. Causal Inference

--

4. Further Adventures in Regression

--

5. ???

# Block 1: Computation 

```{r plot_eelgrass, echo=TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# Load the library ####
library(ggplot2)

# Load the data ####
eelgrass <- read.csv("./data/15q05EelgrassGenotypes.csv")

# Plot ####
ggplot(eelgrass,
       aes(y = shoots, x = treatment.genotypes)) +
  geom_point() +
  stat_smooth(method = "lm") +
  theme_classic(base_size = 17) +
  labs(x = "No. of Genotypes", y = "No. of Shoots per sq. m.")
```

# Block 1: Reproducibility

# Avoiding The Replication Crisis

# Block 2: Regression

```{r plot_eelgrass, fig.align='center', message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
``` 


---

# Block 2: Inference

.center[![:scale 50%](images/01/bayes_popper.png)]

- What is the probability of a hypothesis?
- Is variation explained by a driver of interest?
- Do drivers of interest differ from a null or other expectation?
- How can we generalize from our models to the world?

# Extra Credit 1: Use Github
.center[![:scale 50%](images/01/github.png)]


- This whole class is a github repo  
- Having a github presence is becoming a real advantage  
- So.... create a class repository!
    - folder for homework, folder for exams, folder for labs
- If you submit a link to your homework in a repo, +1 per homework!  
- There will be a github tutorial outside of class hours?

# Extra Credit 2: Be Nate Silver (before the general election)
.center[![:scale 50%](images/01/silver_congress.jpg)]

- Submit your forecast with code!  
      - 5 points for getting the correct answer  
      - 5 extra points for explicitly stating the confidence of your estimates  
      - 5 points for a clear explanation of the methodology  
      - 1 point for each thing you do beyond a weighted average of polls
- Applied to exam

---

Extra Credit 3: Livin' La Vida Data Science

- Check out http://www.r-bloggers.com/ and https://rweekly.org/  

- Listen to podcasts like https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/not-so-standard-deviations/  

- Start going to local R User Groups like https://www.meetup.com/Boston-useR/  

- Follow data science greats on Twitter (see https://twitter.com/jebyrnes/lists/stats-r-on-twitter)  

- +1 point per cool thing you bring up in the beginning of each class or on the UMBRug slack

---

# Extra Credit 4: Help your fellow students
![](images/01/umbrug.jpg)

- Having a problem during homework/exam/etc?
- First, try and solve it yourself (google, stackoverflow, etc.)
- Post a REPRODUCIBLE EXAMPLE to our slack channel
- +1 for answering before I do!
- Will constitute a separate pool of EC at end of semester

---

# Extra Credit 5: Master of the Tidyverse
.center[![](images/01/package.jpg)]

- Write an R package, get a full grade bump
- Yeah, I said it
- See the [http://github.com/covid19R](covid19R project), perhaps?
